Paddle Ninja is a 2D Breakout-style game in which the player controls a paddle and attempts to break bricks with one or more 
endlessly-moving steel balls. I created it using the Unity game engine and the C# programming language. I plan to add more features to the
game in the future.

In its current stage, the game consists of the following features:
  - A variety of screens inlcuding a main menu, an options menu, and a progress menu
  - Eight different collectibles, which appear with a random chance upon breaking a brick and alter one of the following:
    - the behavior of the ball(s) currently in play
    - the player-controlled paddle
  - Five different brick types, each with varying strength and difficulty to break, one of which is unbreakable and does not count towards
    a level's brick count
  - A total of five heart containers per level, each representing one player life; the player starts with three at the beginning of each level
    but can gain (or lose!) more by collecting life-related collectibles

I created original sprites for the ball, paddle, bricks, hearts (player lives), and collectibles. I enjoyed being able to mesh programming and pixel
art into an original game.

I've been passionate about game design for as long as I can remember. I felt that creating this game would help me gain a better understanding
of the game development process.
