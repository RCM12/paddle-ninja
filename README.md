# Paddle Ninja

Paddle Ninja is a 2D Breakout-style game in which the player controls a paddle and attempts to break bricks with one or more 
endlessly-moving steel balls. I created it using the Unity game engine and the C# programming language.

The game consists of the following features:
  - A variety of screens inlcuding a main menu, an options menu, and a progress menu
  - Eight different power-ups, which appear with a random chance upon breaking a brick and alter one of the following:
    - the behavior of the ball(s) currently in play
    - the player-controlled paddle
  - Five different brick types, each with varying strength and difficulty to break, one of which is unbreakable and does not count towards
    a level's brick count
